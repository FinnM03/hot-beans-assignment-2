					<p class="bodytext">Hi, I am Olivia Hobden and I started as a trainee in professional content writing for Hot Beans 2 years ago. I haven't had so much fun working, while learning something new every single day without fail. It is astonishing the amount of knowledge I have gained over the short 2 years I have been here.<br />There is nothing I would change about Hot Beans! We treat our clients with full respect and put in maximum effort on every project. Hot Beans also care about us as employees and trainees, whether this is by employee appreciation day or just our project manager coming over to show their appreciation and check up on how we are doing and if there is anything they could do to support us further. If you are wanting to kick-start your career, Hot Beans is definitely the place to start! </p>

						<p class="jobrole"><a href="careers.html">UX Designer</a></p>
					<p class="bodytext">My name is Alex Williams and I am glad to say I have been a trainee in UX design at Hot Beans for almost 4 years. As I am a UX designer, I haven't only gained a incredible amount of knowledge over the past 4 years, I have gained new life skills and improved those I had previously. One of my responsibilities is meeting the cutomer to gain as much information as I can on how they would like their website to make them 100% satisfied. When I first started at Hot Beans in early 2017, I had very little confidence in myself and my communication skills were not the best. However, Hot Beans gave me the opportunity to change this which it definitely has. I can now meet with a client and discuss their needs with them confidently and in a professional manner and that is all thanks to Hot Beans!</p>

						<p class="jobrole"><a href="careers.html">Testing Specialist</a></p>
					<p class="bodytext">I began at Hot Beans training to become a web designer in 2018. However, when I saw the team of testers at work, I thought that is more suited to me. Hot Beans being as supportive as they are, had no problem moving me from web design to testing, I was testing a week later! It is so much fun trying to find something wrong with a website we have created. It is satifactory when we find an error because we know if we didn't find it, our client, or even worse, their customers would have. We do everything we can to make sure the website is ready for out client.<br />There is no better company to train with than Hot Beans. They are caring, supportive, patient and all of my colleagues I am surrounded by each day are filled with knowledge that they are willing to share with you.</p>

						<p class="jobrole"><a href="careers.html">Web Developer</a></p>
					<p class="bodytext">I'm Mike Ross and I am in my last year of training in website development at Hot Beans after almost 5 years of being here. It is safe to say this has been the best 5 years of my life. Learning everyday, working and teaching others. As well as all of that, I have a guaranteed job once my training has finished. I always grew up wanting to be a lawyer and that was my life plan until I came across Hot Beans. Seeing what they do and who for, it became my mission to be part of it. I started off by learning very basic HTML and CSS. I then completed the Codecademy courses Hot Beans recommends. Soon enough, I became a trainee at Hot Beans.<br />The great thing is, you don't need to be an expert to join Hot Beans. If you do one of the courses we recommend, there's a good chance you'll train here.</p>
